# Assignment 7
## Use packet Tracer tool for configuration of 3 router network using one of the following protocol RIP/OSPF/BGP.
## OSPF
OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a link-state routing protocol used in Internet Protocol (IP) networks to determine the best path for data to travel between devices. It is widely used in large enterprise networks due to its scalability and fast convergence properties.

- **Link-State Protocol:** OSPF builds a complete map (or topology) of the network and uses the Dijkstra algorithm to calculate the shortest path to each destination.

- **Hierarchical Design:** OSPF uses a multi-area design, which helps in reducing routing overhead. The network is divided into areas:

- **Fast Convergence:** OSPF quickly updates routing tables in the event of a network change, helping to minimize downtime.

- **Cost-based Routing:** OSPF uses a cost metric (typically based on bandwidth) to determine the best path, with lower cost links being preferred.

### How does it work?

1. Each router using OSPF shares its link-state advertisements (LSAs) with all other routers in the network.
2. These LSAs contain information about the router's neighbors and the network topology.
3. Routers use this information to construct a link-state database (LSDB) and independently compute the shortest path to each network destination.
