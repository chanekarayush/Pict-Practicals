The interface is very usable and elegant albeit, it does not have any animations or dark mode. <br> 2. It does not have the face of their prime minister or any political figure; uncessarily wasting screen space unlike Indian government websites.           | Nothing (Subjectively)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Brilliant (10/10)               |

The website focuses on the important content, is simple and still interactive to the extent that it makes me audibly gasp with the animations and features. <br> 2. It follows Swiss Design Principles to attain these characteristics                          | I do not understand the need to include movies and songs if the main purpose of the website is to sell Apple Devices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Good (9/10)                     |

The design is very simple yet interactive and to go through their entire catalogue you just need to scroll one page. <br>2. Similar to apple they allow users to customise and build their products on the website itself; very visually pleasing and readable. | For my safety, I dare not say anything foul about it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Great (10/10)                   |

The entire website is a cognitive nightmare, I literally had a headache trying to use the website. <br>2. The contrast ration is very low, the links are not underlined but random text is. <br>3.
