<p><strong>Before coding of the website, planning is important, students should visit different websites<br>
(Min. 5) for the different client projects and note down the evaluation results for these websites,<br>
either good website or bad website.</strong></p>

<th>Overall Evaluation (Good / Bad)</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1.</td>
<td>https://pict.edu/</td>
<td>1. Provide a plaform to announce and display all college activities <br><br>2. Share Educational resources to students such as College Network Architecture, Syllabus and information regarding research programs.</td>
<td>The website has content that is quite useful, informative and important for a student like me and even a person who is looking forward to learn more about the organisation.</td>
<td>1. The Colourscheme and visibility of content.<br>2. Navigation of the website is not intuitive as there are too many menus to choose from.<br>3. Overall Design is not very pleasing.</td>
<td>Bad (5/10)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2.</td>
<td>https://www.youtube.com/</td>
<td>Provide a global plaform to share videos and posts with users across the world.</td>
<td>The website is very responsive for both mobile, laptop and TV.<br> The content can be very informative and helpful and is personalised according to every user.</td>
<td>1. The User Interface is very inconsistent. <br> 2. There are too many options and categories which are not very well organised and are overwhelming initially.</td>
<td>Good (7/10)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3.</td>
<td>https://stripe.com/in</td>
<td>Represents the organisation, Stripe; which provides payment gateway services to customers. <br> A very similar organisation to razorpay</td>
<td>1. It has a really clean and interactive interface. <br> 2. The Navigation is very intuitive and the user can easily find what they're looking for just by scrolling and reading.</td>
<td>The constant animations are sometimes distracting and may trigger photo-epileptic episodes</td>
<td>Good (9/10)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4.</td>
<td>https://linear.app/</td>
<td>Allows users to create Product Design workflows and prototypes. <br> A more mature version of figma, in my opinion</td>
<td>Amazing User Interface, very good use of HTML semantics although the App is probably rendered on a library or framework such as React or Angular respectively.</td>
<td>The Content is a bit verbose.</td>
<td>Good (10/10)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5.</td>
<td>https://tailwindcss.com/</td>
<td>Provides documentation and instructions on how to use the tailwindcss framework.</td>
<td>The website is very simple and intuitive, you can just open it and start typing and it will show you the required documentation. <br> As a developer, it feels nice to have a documentation which is actually usable and good to look at.</td>
<td>I personally think the light mode has too much contrast which makes it less appealing.</td>
<td>Great (10/10)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6.</td>
<td>https://www.gov.uk/</td>
<td>Provides all the government services and information a UK citizen would require in their day to day life.</td>
<td>1. The interface is very usable and elegant albeit, it does not have any animations or dark mode. <br> 2. It does not have the face of their prime minister or any political figure; uncessarily wasting screen space unlike Indian government websites.</td>
<td>Nothing (Subjectively)</td>
<td>Brilliant (10/10)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7.</td>
<td>https://www.apple.com/</td>
<td>Allows users to shop and view electronic devices made by the Technology Company Apple Inc. <br> It also allows them to browse new movies and seek technical support.</td>
<td>1. The website focuses on the important content, is simple and still interactive to the extent that it makes me audibly gasp with the animations and features. <br> 2. It follows Swiss Design Principles to attain these characteristics</td>
<td>I do not understand the need to include movies and songs if the main purpose of the website is to sell Apple Devices.</td>
<td>Good (9/10)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8.</td>
<td>https://dbrand.com/</td>
<td>The website is a platform to provide and buy cases for phones, laptops, tablets and other electronics.</td>
<td>1. The design is very simple yet interactive and to go through their entire catalogue you just need to scroll one page. <br>2. Similar to apple they allow users to customise and build their products on the website itself; very visually pleasing and readable.</td>
<td>For my safety, I dare not say anything foul about it.</td>
<td>Great (10/10)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9.</td>
<td>https://userinyerface.com/</td>
<td>The purpose of this website is to reduce the intense competition in India by neutralising intelligent humans using confusing website interfaces.</td>
<td>There is nothing good about this website as it was built to showcase everything which you should not do while making a website.</td>
<td>1. The entire website is a cognitive nightmare, I literally had a headache trying to use the website. <br>2. The contrast ration is very low, the links are not underlined but random text is. <br>3. There is no submit button on the form, just a cancel button.<br>4. Everything is inconsistent to the point where it is not readable on the screen.</td>
<td>Terrible, made me cry (0/10)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10.</td>
<td>https://leetcode.com/</td>
<td>The website is meant as a practice platform for users preparing for Coding Interviews.</td>
<td>1. The website has an intuitive design and systematic navigation structures.<br>2. Shortcuts are provided to users to make tasks faster while typing code.</td>
<td>The feature to test speed and time complexity is flawed as it gives inconsistent results.</td>
<td>Good (8/10)</td>
